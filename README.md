## Objective

My name is Zachary Reyna, and I am a cybersecurity professional and finance graduate with a passion for solving complex problems and continuously learning. This repository showcases my technical projects, hands-on practice, and innovative solutions, reflecting my journey in the cybersecurity and financial sectors.

I hold a Cybersecurity Analytics certificate from the University of Texas at Dallas powered by Fullstack Academy, where I gained expertise in penetration testing, Linux, Python scripting, networking, and cybersecurity frameworks. I also earned a BBA in Finance from the University of Houstonâ€™s C.T. Bauer College of Business, providing me with a strong foundation in financial analysis, strategic planning, and leadership.

My professional experience spans multiple roles, including my current position as a Penetration Tester (Journeyman) at Secure Evolution. I have honed my skills in network enumeration, lateral movement strategies, and security testing while developing playbooks and improving operational security processes. During my time as a Cybersecurity Intern, I automated reconnaissance tasks, deployed practice environments, and explored Active Directory attack techniques. Before transitioning into cybersecurity, I worked as a Financial Renewables Coordinator at Duke Energy, where I managed high-voltage maintenance programs, implemented secure networks, and streamlined procurement processes.

In addition to my professional accomplishments, I am certified in CompTIA Security+ and am pursuing further advanced certifications, such as the CREST Practitioner Security Analyst and Attacking Active Directory with Linux.
